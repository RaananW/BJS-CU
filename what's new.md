 - Assets are then loaded once until you change the version on a server-side manifest
- N-Level octrees ([deltakosh](http://www.github.com/deltakosh)):
**Updates**
- Adding ```dispose()``` function and a ```disposeWhenFinishedAnimating``` property to sprites ([Cyle](http://github.com/CYle/))
- Adding a ```applyTransform()``` function to meshes in order to bake a specific transformation into vertices ([deltakosh](http://www.github.com/deltakosh))
- Adding ```setPivotMatrix()``` and ```getPivotMatrix()``` to meshes to define pivot matrix ([deltakosh](http://www.github.com/deltakosh))
- ```Mesh.CreateCylinder``` now takes two diameters as parameters to be able to create cone ([deltakosh](http://www.github.com/deltakosh)) 
- New ```material.Clone``` function ([deltakosh](http://www.github.com/deltakosh)) 
**Bugfixes**
- ```scene.IsReady()``` is more robust now and can be used to detect when the scene is EFFECTIVELY ready :) ([deltakosh](http://www.github.com/deltakosh))
- Fixing animations timing. Animations should be in sync now ([deltakosh](http://www.github.com/deltakosh))
- Fixing a bug with orthographic camera ([deltakosh](http://www.github.com/deltakosh))

- 1.3.2:
 - Fixing a bug with camera.detachControl
- 1.3.0:
 - Selection octrees
 - Breaking changes: Meshes now use multi vertex buffers (one for each attribute) instead of a big one. This is for more flexibility. The .babylon file format has changed accordingly (no more .vertices property on meshes but .positions, .normals, .colors, .uvs, .uvs2)
