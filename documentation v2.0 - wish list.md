* Must have:
 * Website available on Github to allow community to work on it
 * Deployment from Github to Azure directly (for my convenience :)): http://azure.microso...source-control/
 * Mobile version
 * Better visual design
 * Resizable TOC
 * Empty page should be redesigned
 * Empty page in Classes should display the list of classes (For instance clicking on 2.0 should display all classes from 2.0 and so on)
 * Ability to deep link to all headers inside a page
 * Ability to deep link to any function inside a class page
 * Fixing some display bugs like http://doc.babylonjs...age.php?p=25073
 * Display inheritance and children in a class page
 * Better (and faster) search
 * Correct class-hierarchy (Node -> Abstract Mesh -> Mesh , for example)
 * Syntax highlighting for javascript
 * For admins : Display differences between two pages in Pending validation
 * Short sample code for each class member functions
 
* Nice to have:
 * Ability to move page from one section to another
 * Ability to see page's history 
 * The tutorial's date updated in front of the author
